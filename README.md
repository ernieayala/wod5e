This system is for playing multiple World of Darkness 5th edition systems on the Foundry Virtual Tabletop System. For a list of the latest changes, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/WoD5E-Developers/wod5e/releases). You can also read further about the system in general on the [WOD5E Documentation](https://wod5e-developers.github.io/) site!

Current supported systems include:
* Vampire the Masquerade, 5th Edition
* Hunter the Reckoning, 5th Edition
* Werewolf the Apocalypse, 5th Edition

## Dice

To roll the splat-unique dice, replace the usual roll formula like so:
* To roll Vampire dice, roll `1dv`. To roll Hunger dice, roll `1dg`.
* To roll Hunter dice, roll `1dh`. To roll Desperation dice, roll `1ds`.
* To roll Werewolf dice, roll `1dw`. To roll Rage dice, roll `1dr`.

Replace the 1s with however many you want to roll for each type, and let the dice roll! We also have compatibility with the [Dice So Nice!](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice/) module, so whenever you roll splat dice you'll get the World of Darkness 5th edition symbols on the 3D dice faces.
